# eye-strain-detector
An eye strain detector built for raspberry pi, using a live camera feed to update graphs on a locally hosted site. (Random data generator included for testing purposes).
**The facial landmark map used in the project was too large to be uploaded here, but is found as 'shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat'.
